### Hey 👋

**I'm Fabian, 19 y/o student and full-stack web developer from Germany.**

I love working with all sorts of technologies to create full-stack web applications 🧑‍💻

I particularly like working with **JavaScript/Node.js**, **React**, **PHP** and **Go**.

Since 2021, I have been working as a **full-stack developer** at a company creating e-commerce solutions for **WordPress** 🛒
