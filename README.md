# About me

Hey 👋

**I'm Fabian, 19 y/o student and full-stack web developer from Germany.**

I love working with all sorts of technologies to create full-stack web applications 🧑‍💻

I particularly like working with **[React](https://react.dev/)** and **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** on the front end and **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**, **[Go](https://go.dev/)** or **JavaScript/[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)** on the back end.

So far, I've already worked on quite a few real-world projects 🌐

<br />

**In 2021, I started working as a full-stack developer** at a company creating e-commerce solutions for **WordPress** 🛒

Through my work experience with WordPress, I've learned that modern **WordPress and PHP development** can be very versatile and can provide an amazing user experience (if done right) 🔥

I learned a lot about building WordPress plugins to realize complex web projects while making use of things like the Gutenberg Editor (powered by React) and Settings APIs to achieve a high degree of customizability for users 🖥️ 🎨

<br />

While completely rebuilding my website, I started a **[blog](https://fabiancdng.com/blog)** to sporadically and casually share some of the projects I'm working on and to create a "glossary" of solutions for issues I came across on my coding journey 📝
