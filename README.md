# About me

Hey 👋

I'm Fabian, a 16 y/o student from Germany.

I'm interested in (almost) everything involving programming, software, and tech. 🖥️

I'm a self-taught full-stack developer (mainly writing web applications) but still in the process of learning. 🧠

I'm most experienced with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Go](https://golang.org), and JavaScript, particularly in creating back-end and server applications. But I've also recently been doing a lot of front-end related projects/work mainly involving [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

Besides that, I'm also interested in networking and databases as I'm experienced with [traefik](https://traefik.io/), Apache, MySQL (MariaDB), [Redis](https://redis.io/) (currently learning), and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) (currently learning).

I love working with servers and Linux. Preferably in combination with Docker and docker-compose. 🐳

Additionally, I love to automate things that have to do with server administration, deployment, maintenance, etc. 🤖

You can find a lot of my projects here on GitHub as I'm a huge fan of open-source.

My projects as well as [my blog posts](https://blog.fabiancdng.com) help me learn and document what I've learned so far.
