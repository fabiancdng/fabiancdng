# About me

Hey 👋

**I'm Fabian, a 17 y/o student and full-stack developer from Germany.**

I'm interested in (almost) everything involving programming, software, and tech. 🖥️

Using the skills I have acquired over the years, I create full-stack (web) applications with **[Python](https://python.org)**, **JavaScript**, and **[Go](https://go.dev)**.

I love to cover various aspects of the projects I'm working on:
* Developing a powerful and efficient back end and RESTful APIs 🔌
* Creating the front end with modern technologies like **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** and **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** 💻
* Designing clean, simple, and responsive UIs and creating good experiences for users 🎨
* Deploying and hosting my projects while often taking care of networking and scaling myself 🌐

Throughout the last 1.5 years, I have also worked a lot with **[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)**. Mostly developing WordPress plugins using **[PHP](https://php.net)** and **JavaScript**. I have gained a lot of expertise when it comes to utilizing WordPress and its modern Gutenberg editor and block APIs for plugins.

Besides that, I'm also interested in basic networking. I love using tools like **[Docker](https://docker.com)** and **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)** to deploy and manage my web apps across servers while utilizing its networking capabilities to create a simple, secure, and efficient infrastructure for all my projects. 🐳

Additionaly, I love to automate everything using custom scripts or CI/CD solutions like **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** or **[Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/en/features/pipelines)**. 🤖
